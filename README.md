# Late Summer School - Deep Learning with Text

## Installation
First, you will need to install [git](https://git-scm.com/), if not existing on your machine.

Next, clone this repository, open a terminal and type in the following commands:

    $ cd <to any workspace folder you like> 
    $ git clone https://github.com/spinfo/LSS_DLwithText.git
    $ cd LSS_DLwithText

You do not need to install git. You can also download the repo [master.zip](https://github.com/spinfo/LSS_DLwithText/archive/master.zip) and unzip it in your preferred workspace.

## Anaconda
The easiest approach to open Notebooks is to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). This is a piece of software that includes both Python and many machine learning libraries.

You can install Keras in the Anaconda Navigator by opening Anaconda Navigator and switching to Environments. It is useful to define different environments for different projects but we will use base (root) environment. Pick up "Not installed" in the Drop Down Menu. Next, type in "Keras" in the "Search Package" Text field and install latest Keras version.

You're done with the installation. Next section describes how to open now the Jupyter notebooks.

## Starting Jupyter
Open Anaconda Prompt and type in:

    $ cd <to any workspace folder you like>/LSS_DLwithText/src
    $ jupyter notebook

This should open up your browser, and you should see Jupyter's tree view, with all the notebooks. 

Note: If your browser does not open automatically, open manually [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888/tree).

Let's get started!
